---

### **2.3 Data Storage Configuration**

- [ ] Add **Core Data** to the project for local storage.  
- [ ] Define data models in Core Data for:
  - Objects (name, image, pronunciation, SRS data).  
  - SRS schedule (last review date, interval, performance).  
  - User achievements and progress.  
- [ ] Implement a simple **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for testing.  

---

### **3. Building Core Features**

---

### **3.1 Explore Mode**

- [ ] Create a **UIViewController** for the camera interface using ARKit.  
- [ ] Integrate **Core ML** for real-time object recognition.  
- [ ] Design and implement **UIViews for popups** with Chinese names, pinyin, and pronunciation.  
- [ ] Implement **speech recording** and send audio to SpeechSuper API for assessment.  
- [ ] Provide **feedback on pronunciation** (correct or retry).  
- [ ] Save correctly pronounced objects to Core Data.  
- [ ] Test for **accuracy and performance** on multiple devices.  

---

### **3.2 Practice Mode**

- [ ] Design a **UIViewController** for quizzes (object images and multiple-choice questions).  
- [ ] Create custom **UITableViewCells** or **UICollectionViewCells** for quiz items.
- [ ] Retrieve objects from **Core Data** based on SRS schedule.  
- [ ] Develop a **custom SRS algorithm** in Swift (Leitner or SM-2).  
- [ ] Implement a **point system** for correct answers.  
- [ ] Provide **pronunciation feedback** using SpeechSuper and AudioKit.  
- [ ] Test **SRS functionality** for appropriate intervals and difficulty.  

---

### **3.3 Pronunciation Feedback**

- [ ] Extract **pitch and tone** using AudioKit.  
- [ ] Compare user pronunciation to **reference pitch** for tone accuracy.  
- [ ] Display **visual feedback** (green for correct, red for incorrect) using UIKit animations.  
- [ ] Store **performance data** in Core Data for future quizzes.  

---

### **4. Gamification Elements**

- [ ] Create a **UIViewController** for dashboard displaying points, levels, and achievements.  
- [ ] Design custom **UIViews** for badges and progress indicators.
- [ ] Define **achievement criteria** (e.g., 10 correct pronunciations in a row).  
- [ ] Store and update **progress data** in Core Data.  
- [ ] Implement **notifications or popups** for new levels or badges.  

---

### **5. User Interface Design**

- [ ] Create **UIKit components** for:
  - Explore mode (camera, popups).  
  - Practice mode (quizzes, feedback).  
  - Dashboard (points, achievements).  
- [ ] Design a **consistent UI theme** with colors and icons.  
- [ ] Create **Storyboards or XIB files** for main interface components.
- [ ] Ensure **responsive design** for different screen sizes (iPhone SE to iPhone 14 Pro Max).  
- [ ] Implement **Auto Layout constraints** for proper UI scaling.
- [ ] Test for **usability and accessibility** (VoiceOver and contrast ratios).  

---

### **6. Performance Optimization**

- [ ] Optimize **Core ML models** for mobile performance (quantization, pruning).  
- [ ] Test **ARKit frame rates** and adjust for lag or delay.  
- [ ] Minimize **network requests** for SpeechSuper API using caching.  
- [ ] Implement **background tasks** for data saving in Core Data.  
- [ ] Monitor memory usage and optimize as needed.  
- [ ] Implement proper **view controller lifecycle management** to prevent memory leaks.

---

### **7. Offline Functionality**

- [ ] Ensure **Core ML and AudioKit** work offline.  
- [ ] Cache pronunciation files locally using **AVFoundation**.  
- [ ] Validate **Core Data sync** without internet.  
- [ ] Test **full app functionality** in airplane mode.  

---

### **8. Permissions and Security**

- [ ] Request permissions for:
  - Camera access (ARKit).  
  - Microphone access (Speech).  
  - Speech recognition (SpeechSuper API).  
- [ ] Encrypt **Core Data** storage for user data security.  
- [ ] Implement a **privacy policy** in the app settings.  

---

### **9. Testing and QA**

- [ ] Write **unit tests** for:
  - Object recognition accuracy.  
  - Pronunciation feedback logic.  
  - SRS scheduling and data retrieval.  
- [ ] Conduct **integration testing** for:
  - ARKit and Core ML.  
  - Audio recording and SpeechSuper API.  
- [ ] Perform **UI testing** for:
  - Navigation between explore and practice modes.  
  - Responsiveness on different screen sizes.  
- [ ] Gather **beta tester feedback** via TestFlight.  
- [ ] Fix bugs and optimize based on tester input.  

---

### **10. App Store Preparation**
